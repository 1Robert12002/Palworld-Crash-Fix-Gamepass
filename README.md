This program fixes the Palworld crashes when sharing Xbox Gamepass with other people.
The program works by ending the file explorer task while the game is running and restarting it after the game is closed. 
While the program is running you won't be able to switch tabs.

Note: This fix won't help with any Unreal Engine related crashes.
